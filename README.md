# DeepDreamPlacesGifs
Using Google's Deep Dream with the MIT Places CNN to create gifs of hidden worlds inside of images

This is a twist on the Deep Dream repository that Google released a few weeks ago here -

We used the MIT Places CNN instead of ImageNet, which you'll find a guide for here -

We're also using the ImageMagick library to build the image series into Gifs.
